# Rally Standard Library

This is very incomplete but has some useful stuff for printing, math, basic memory operations and file io. The file io is definitely not complete so be a little careful if you're trying to capture specific errors. You may want to fall back to using the rally-clib wrapper if you need all functionality. 

It will be developed further and made stable ASAP, but for now use it at your own risk.
